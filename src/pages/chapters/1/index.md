# 1. Why this exists

How good are spreadsheets? The tabular Atlas holding the business world on their back - most problems
can be solved in Excel and many white collared workers believe that most problems _should_ be solved
in Excel. I admire the problem solving skills, but there are points where spreadsheet begins to buckle and bend.

The modern professional environment has taught me that:

1. No companies actually want us working from home anymore
2. People are scared of databases

It was a recurring tale during my time at a business intelligence consultancy - professionals thrive in the spreadsheet. Databases are terrifying.
